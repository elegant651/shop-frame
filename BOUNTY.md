# Open Frames Bounty

Welcome to the Open Frames Bounty Program! ðŸš€ If you're passionate about interoperability and eager to make your Frame a part of the ever-growing Open Frames ecosystem, you're in the right place. By following the steps you will enhance your Frame with the necessary metadata for Open Frames compatibility, according to this [standard](https://github.com/open-frames/standard). Let's dive in!

### Step 1: Modify the Metadata in Your Frame

First, you need to add the specified metadata to your Frame. Based on the provided context, it looks like you're working with a TypeScript file in a project. Here's how you can add the metadata depending on your environment:

**HTML**

```html
<meta property="of:accepts:xmtp" content="2024-02-01" />
```

**OnChainKit**

```jsx
export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: /*Your frame metadata*/,
  description: /*Your frame metadata*/,
  openGraph: {/*Your frame metadata*/},
  other: {
    ...frameMetadata,
    'of:accepts:xmtp': '2024-02-01', // Ensure this line is added or updated
  },
};
```

**FramesJS**

```jsx
//code sample soon
```

2. **Clone Your Fork**: Clone the forked repository to your local machine.

3. **Modify the README.md**: Add your Frame to the `Compatible Frames` section. Follow the formatting used by other entries in the list.

4. **Commit and Push Your Changes**: Commit the changes to your fork and push them.

5. **Create a Pull Request**: Navigate to the original Awesome-Open-Frames repository on GitHub. You should see an option to create a pull request based on the changes you pushed to your fork. Fill out the necessary details and submit the PR.

### Step 3: Send Your Frame via DM
